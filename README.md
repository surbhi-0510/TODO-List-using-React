# TODO-List-using-React


The project that I have done in React was to build a TODO LIST, wherein as a user, I can: 

o	Read a list of tasks,

o	Add a task using enter button,

o	Mark any task as completed by striking through the item,

o	Remove any task using Remove button,

o	View a specific subset of tasks: All tasks or only the uncompleted tasks will be shown on clicking the button.

The duration of the project was of 2 weeks, and it was a self-learning project done in a team of two. 

In this project, I have used JavaScript higher order functions like map and filter, React hooks like useState, React state management with the help of hooks, React conditional rendering for displaying all tasks or the only the uncompleted tasks. I have also used the features of ES6 like spread operator and arrow function. To make the UI more attractive, I have used CSS properties like flex, background image, strike property and Pseudo-Class like hover etc.
